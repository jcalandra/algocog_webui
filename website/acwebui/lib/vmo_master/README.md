About
-----
vmo is a Python library for time series and symbolic sequence analysis/synthesis 
in the family of software built around the Factor Oracle and Variable Markov Oracle algorithms. 
One of the main innovations in vmo is using functions related to Information Dynamics to
determine oracle structure and query-matching algorithms.



Dependencies
------------
Numpy, Scipy, librosa & sklearn, music21 and pretty_midi. 


Installation
------------
run 
```python setup.py install```
or 
```pip install vmo```
