    This example shows how to parse a music mxl file (music21 and musescore/finale required) 
    and create a simple oracle representation. The output is a reshuffled midi stream shown
    in either musescore or finale based on your installation of music21. 
    
    OPTIONAL ARGS:
        seq_len: an integer for the length of the output sequence. 
        p: a float of the probability using the forward links.
        k: an integer for the starting state.
        LRS: an integer for the lower limit of the LRS of sfx/rsfx allowed to 
            jump to.
        weight:
            None: choose uniformly among all the possible sfx/rsfx given 
                current state.
            "max": always choose the sfx/rsfx having the longest LRS.
            "weight": choose sfx/rsfx in a way that favors longer ones than 
            shorter ones.
